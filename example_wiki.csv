"Machine Learning","Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.","https://wiki.example.com/machine-learning","Technology"
"Deep Learning","Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.","https://wiki.example.com/deep-learning","Technology"
"Python Programming","Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.","https://wiki.example.com/python","Programming"
"Neural Networks","A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.","https://wiki.example.com/neural-networks","AI"
